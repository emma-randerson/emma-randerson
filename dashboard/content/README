# Deployment

The dashboard is deployed on AIS as a WebApp.

## Beta
beta: This is a beta dashboard, where changes and testing is done. It lives on the beta branch. Once testing is completed, a pull request is made to the master branch, to update the prod dashboard.

For saving files, if the dashboard variable in the `app.R` file is set to `dashboard = beta` then the s3 files are saved to `/beta` folders on s3. This prevents testing on the beta dashboard contaminating data the master dashboard points to.

## Prod
dashboard name: This is the dashboard customer uses. It lives on the master branch
